Hi my name is Adrian Yadav.

Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice.

## Industry design and media

You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.

## Hobbies

I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. What? What?! WHAT?! Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.
